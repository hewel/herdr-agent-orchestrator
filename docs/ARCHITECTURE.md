# Herdr Agent Orchestrator

## Overview

**Herdr Agent Orchestrator** is a Rust-based control plane for running, supervising, and coordinating coding agents inside Herdr-managed terminal environments.

The orchestrator separates:

- Agent providers
- Agent roles
- Concrete tasks
- Execution policies
- Workflow dependencies
- Repository safety
- Structured artifacts
- Herdr presentation

The initial implementation supports:

- OMP
- Codex
- Explicit provider selection
- Built-in roles
- Bounded task execution
- Repository write-scope enforcement
- Verification commands
- Persistent run state
- Herdr status metadata
- Popup task inspection
- Cancellation and pane focusing

Planned provider expansion:

- Pi
- OpenCode
- Additional CLI or RPC-based coding agents

The parent agent remains responsible for intent, architecture decisions, task decomposition, acceptance criteria, verification design, final diff review, and the user-facing response. Child agents receive only bounded, reversible, and objectively verifiable tasks.

## Final Architectural Decision

Herdr Agent Orchestrator is the **single top-level authority**.

OMP, Codex, Pi, and OpenCode are providers. They are not allowed to independently own the top-level workflow.

    Registry --> HerdrUI["Herdr Panes, Metadata, and Popup"]
```

This avoids having several competing orchestration systems:

- Herdr pane and workspace management
- OMP native multi-agent coordination
- OpenCode child-session coordination
- A custom workflow runtime

Only Herdr Agent Orchestrator manages the top-level workflow. Provider-native multi-agent features may later be exposed as controlled nested capabilities.

## Design Principles

### Separate Provider, Role, Task, and Policy

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Provider["Provider<br/>OMP, Codex, Pi, OpenCode"] --> Assignment["Agent Assignment"]
    Role["Role<br/>Implementer, Reviewer, Verifier"] --> Assignment
    Task["Task<br/>Concrete objective"] --> Assignment
    Policy["Policy<br/>Tools, writes, delegation"] --> Assignment

    Assignment --> Run["Agent Run"]
    Run --> Artifact["Structured Artifact"]
```

Each concept answers a different question:

| Concept | Question |
| --- | --- |
| Provider | Which execution engine runs the task? |
| Role | What responsibility does the agent have? |
| Task | What concrete outcome must be produced? |
| Policy | What is the agent permitted to do? |

A role must not be permanently tied to a provider.

Valid combinations include:

```text
OMP + Implementer
OMP + Reviewer
Codex + Implementer
Codex + Reviewer
Pi + Implementer
Pi + Verifier
OpenCode + Reviewer
```

### Prompts Describe; Policies Enforce

A prompt may tell a reviewer not to modify files.

The runtime must additionally:

- Remove editing tools where possible
- Use an empty write scope
- Capture a [Repository Snapshot](research/mvp/repository-safety-contract.md)
- Detect unexpected changes
- Reject the run if repository boundaries are violated

Prompts describe expected behavior. Policies enforce hard constraints.

### Structured Artifacts Over Shared Conversation History

Cross-provider collaboration uses structured artifacts rather than native chat history.

Recommended artifact types:

- `ImplementationReport`
- `ReviewReport`
- `VerificationReport`
- `ResearchReport`
- `HandoffPacket`
- `DecisionRequest`
- `CorrectionPacket`

This allows an OMP implementation result to be reviewed by Codex or Pi without converting provider-native sessions.

## Delegation Modes

The runtime supports three conceptual modes.

```rust
pub enum DelegationMode {
    Managed,
    Native,
    Hybrid,
}
```

### Managed Mode

All workflow nodes are created and controlled by Herdr Agent Orchestrator.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Orchestrator --> Implementer["OMP · Implementer"]
    Orchestrator --> Reviewer["Codex · Reviewer"]
    Orchestrator --> Verifier["Pi · Verifier"]
```

Managed mode provides:

- Uniform status
- Uniform policy enforcement
- Cross-provider workflows
- Centralized repository safety
- Predictable cancellation
- Provider replacement
- Simple debugging

This is the default and the only mode supported by the MVP.

### Native Mode

A provider uses its own multi-agent implementation.

Examples:

- OMP `task + hub`
- OpenCode child sessions

Native mode is not initially exposed as an unrestricted user option.

### Hybrid Mode

The top-level workflow remains managed by the orchestrator, but an individual provider run may create controlled native children.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Workflow["Orchestrator Workflow"]

    Workflow --> Implementation["OMP · Implementer"]
    Workflow --> Review["Codex · Reviewer"]
    Workflow --> Verification["Pi · Verifier"]

    Implementation --> Scout["OMP Native Scout"]
    Implementation --> TestHelper["OMP Native Test Helper"]
```

Recommended Hybrid restrictions:

- Native depth limited to one
- Native children belong to their parent `AgentRun`
- Native children cannot create top-level workflow nodes
- Native edits count against the parent write scope
- Native token, timeout, and concurrency usage count against the parent
- Only providers with observable native children may enable Hybrid mode

## Core Domain Model

### Caller assignment

```rust
pub struct AssignmentInputV1 {
    pub provider: ProviderKind,
    pub profile_id: String,
    pub role: BuiltInRole,
}
```

The caller selects every provider, profile, and role explicitly. It does not
select delegation mode, model, tools, prompts, environment, output schema, or
effective policy. Managed mode and runtime authority are resolved internally.

### Run Submission

```rust
pub enum RunSubmissionV1 {
    AgentRun {
        request_key: Option<String>,
        worktree_path: AbsoluteWorktreePath,
        timeout_seconds: u32,
        assignment: AssignmentInputV1,
        task: TaskInputV1,
    },
    WorkflowRun {
        request_key: Option<String>,
        worktree_path: AbsoluteWorktreePath,
        timeout_seconds: u32,
        assignments: FixedWorkflowAssignmentsV1,
        task: TaskInputV1,
    },
}
```

The public contract is a strict, versioned tagged union. An individual
submission creates one `AgentRun`; a workflow submission creates the fixed
implementer → reviewer → verifier workflow and preallocates all three child
run IDs. Callers never provide run IDs. Every repository scope has an explicit
`exact_file` or `subtree` kind; path spelling never implies scope semantics.

Example individual submission:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "kind": "agent_run",
  "request_key": "download-race-v1",
  "worktree_path": "/workspace/herdr-agent-orchestrator",
  "timeout_seconds": 1800,
  "assignment": {
    "provider": "omp",
    "profile_id": "omp-managed-default",
    "role": "implementer"
  },
  "task": {
    "title": "Fix download queue race",
    "objective": "Prevent duplicate queue insertion",
    "context_paths": ["src/download/queue.rs"],
    "requirements": ["Preserve the existing public API"],
    "acceptance_criteria": ["Concurrent insertions produce one queue entry"],
    "repository": {
      "write_scopes": [
        { "kind": "exact_file", "path": "src/download/queue.rs" },
        { "kind": "subtree", "path": "tests/download" }
      ],
      "scratch_scopes": [],
      "ignored_publish_paths": [],
      "destructive_authorizations": []
    },
    "verification": [
      {
        "id": "download-queue-tests",
        "command": "cargo test download_queue",
        "expected": "Exit 0 with focused tests passing"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Resolved Run Spec

After durable acceptance the orchestrator generates IDs and freezes the
selected configuration into digest-addressed snapshots. A sealed
`ResolvedTopLevelRunSpecV1` records the canonical submission digest, root
deadline, resolved repository identity and authority, Repository Snapshot,
Managed mode, and immutable profile, role, policy, task, and orchestrator
snapshot references. Mutable sessions, panes, progress, and publication state
remain outside it.

Each provider invocation receives a separately sealed
`ResolvedAgentRunSpecV1`. For a workflow child it links the immutable root,
preallocated child ID, fixed node assignment, late-bound input Artifact
references, node budget, and repository/safety snapshots without mutating the
workflow root.

The complete public input, idempotency, dirty-confirmation, deadline, snapshot,
and compatibility rules are normative in the
[public run contract](research/mvp/public-run-contract.md). Checked-in Draft
2020-12 schemas and golden fixtures live under [`schemas/`](../schemas/).

## Provider Adapter Layer

All provider-specific behavior is hidden behind one Rust interface.

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait AgentProvider: Send + Sync {
    fn kind(&self) -> ProviderKind;

    fn capabilities(&self) -> ProviderCapabilities;

    async fn start(
        &self,
        spec: &ResolvedAgentRunSpecV1,
        context: &RunContext,
    ) -> Result<ProviderSession>;

    async fn send(
        &self,
        session: &ProviderSession,
        input: AgentInput,
    ) -> Result<()>;

    async fn resume(
        &self,
        session: &ProviderSession,
        input: AgentInput,
    ) -> Result<()>;

    async fn cancel(
        &self,
        session: &ProviderSession,
    ) -> Result<()>;

    async fn subscribe(
        &self,
        session: &ProviderSession,
    ) -> Result<AgentEventStream>;

    async fn read_transcript(
        &self,
        session: &ProviderSession,
    ) -> Result<Transcript>;

    async fn list_children(
        &self,
        session: &ProviderSession,
    ) -> Result<Vec<ProviderChildSession>>;
}
```

### Provider Capabilities

```rust
pub struct ProviderCapabilities {
    pub persistent_session: bool;
    pub resumable: bool;
    pub cancellable: bool;
    pub structured_events: bool;
    pub background_execution: bool;

    pub native_subagents: bool;
    pub child_session_tree: bool;
    pub peer_messaging: bool;
}
```

Capability negotiation prevents the shared runtime from assuming that every provider supports the same native behavior.

## Provider Capability Matrix

| Capability | OMP | Codex | Pi | OpenCode |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Persistent session | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Structured event stream | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Cancellation | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Steering or follow-up | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Native subagents | Yes | Not required initially | No built-in system | Yes |
| Child-session tree | Agent registry | Thread and turn | Session branches, not role children | Yes |
| Peer messaging | `hub` | No shared peer bus | No built-in peer bus | No built-in peer bus |
| Provider-native resume | Session and messaging | Thread continuation | Session continuation | `task_id` continuation |
| Recommended initial mode | Managed | Managed | Managed | Managed |

## OMP Provider

Run OMP through:

```bash
omp --mode rpc
```

The Rust adapter communicates through JSONL over stdin and stdout.

OMP provides:

- Agent lifecycle events
- Tool lifecycle events
- Cancellation
- Session control
- Host-owned tools
- Native subagent subscriptions
- Subagent transcript access
- Native peer messaging through `hub`

OMP core multi-agent execution creates independent subagent sessions. It supports synchronous and asynchronous tasks, artifacts, transcripts, bounded concurrency, and follow-up messaging.

OMP RPC can expose:

```text
subagent_lifecycle
subagent_progress
subagent_event
```

The host can also use:

```text
set_subagent_subscription
get_subagents
get_subagent_messages
```

### Initial OMP Policy

For MVP:

- Disable or omit native task delegation
- Run OMP as a single managed worker
- Register host-owned structured completion tools
- Let the orchestrator own verification and repository validation

### Later Hybrid OMP Policy

After the managed runtime is stable:

- Enable OMP native read-only children
- Subscribe to child events
- Display children in the Herdr popup
- Limit native depth to one
- Keep editing children disabled by default
- Map OMP `hub` messages into the orchestrator message model

## Codex Provider

Run Codex through:

```bash
codex app-server
```

The adapter uses the App Server protocol and manages:

```text
initialize
thread/start
turn/start
turn/interrupt
```

The adapter preserves:

- Thread ID
- Current turn
- Streaming items
- Completion status
- Interruption state
- Transcript references

Codex is initially treated as a managed single-agent provider. Native multi-agent behavior is not required for the first architecture. The orchestrator can create several independent Codex runs when multiple roles are needed.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Orchestrator
    participant Codex as Codex App Server

    Orchestrator->>Codex: initialize
    Codex-->>Orchestrator: capabilities

    Orchestrator->>Codex: thread/start
    Codex-->>Orchestrator: thread ID

    Orchestrator->>Codex: turn/start
    Codex-->>Orchestrator: turn events

    Codex-->>Orchestrator: turn/completed
    Orchestrator->>Orchestrator: Build artifact
```

## Pi Provider

Pi is integrated as a managed single-agent provider.

Pi is an Agent Harness composed of:

```text
Model
+ System Prompt
+ Tools
+ Message History
+ Agent Loop
+ Session Runtime
```

The repository separates its implementation into:

- `pi-ai`: provider-independent model access
- `pi-agent-core`: Agent Loop, state, tools, and events
- `pi-coding-agent`: coding tools, sessions, extensions, and terminal modes

Pi deliberately does not ship a built-in role or subagent system. Its default coding agent exposes `read`, `bash`, `edit`, and `write`, while extensions and the SDK can add new tools and workflows.

Run Pi through:

```bash
pi --mode rpc
```

The Rust provider can use:

```text
prompt
steer
follow_up
abort
new_session
get_state
get_messages
set_model
set_thinking_level
```

Pi RPC exposes JSONL commands, responses, and streaming events over stdin and stdout.

### Pi Provider Mapping

| Orchestrator concept | Pi capability |
| --- | --- |
| Provider session | `AgentSession` |
| Session identity | Pi session ID |
| Start task | `prompt` |
| Steering | `steer` |
| Follow-up | `follow_up` |
| Cancel | `abort` |
| State | `get_state` |
| Transcript | `get_messages` or Session JSONL |
| Role behavior | System prompt |
| Tool policy | Tool allowlist and custom tools |
| Persistence | `SessionManager` |
| Events | AgentSession event stream |

Pi's Agent Loop repeatedly:

1. Sends system prompt, messages, and tools to the model
2. Streams the assistant response
3. Executes tool calls
4. Adds tool results to context
5. Calls the model again
6. Stops when no more work remains

### Pi Role Construction

The orchestrator can create distinct Pi role instances by changing:

- System prompt
- Tool allowlist
- Model
- Thinking level
- Skills
- Session manager
- Workspace

Example:

```text
Pi + Implementer
  tools: read, bash, edit, write

Pi + Reviewer
  tools: read, bash
  write scope: empty

Pi + Verifier
  tools: read, bash
  verification-only policy
```

Pi does not own the top-level workflow or create role agents itself. The orchestrator creates one Pi session per managed role.

## Future OpenCode Provider

OpenCode uses a Primary Agent and Child Session model.

A subagent invocation creates a real child session with:

- Session ID
- Parent session ID
- Agent type
- Model
- Permission rules
- Persistent messages
- Token and cost data

A later instruction can continue that child session by passing its existing `task_id`.

The OpenCode provider maps:

| Orchestrator concept | OpenCode capability |
| --- | --- |
| Provider session | OpenCode Session |
| Child identity | Child Session ID |
| Continue work | `task_id` |
| Role definition | OpenCode Agent configuration |
| Tool policy | Permission rules |
| Parent-child relation | Session `parentID` |
| Background work | Background Job, currently experimental |

OpenCode background subagents currently depend on an experimental feature flag, so they are not required by the initial provider implementation.

## Role System

Built-in MVP roles:

```text
implementer
reviewer
verifier
```

Future roles:

```text
planner
researcher
debugger
test-writer
documentation-writer
security-reviewer
frontend-specialist
release-manager
coordinator
```

### Role Definition

```rust
pub struct RoleDefinition {
    pub id: String,
    pub display_name: String,
    pub description: String,

    pub system_prompt: String,
    pub allowed_providers: Vec<ProviderKind>,
    pub preferred_provider: Option<ProviderKind>,

    pub policy: RolePolicy,
    pub output_schema: String,
    pub skills: Vec<String>,
}
```

### Role Policy

```rust
pub struct RolePolicy {
    pub can_modify_files: bool,
    pub can_delegate: bool,

    pub requires_write_scope: bool,
    pub requires_verification: bool,

    pub allowed_tools: Vec<String>,
    pub denied_tools: Vec<String>,

    pub allowed_child_roles: Vec<String>,
    pub max_delegation_depth: u8,
    pub max_child_agents: usize,
}
```

### Configuration

```text
$HERDR_PLUGIN_CONFIG_DIR/
├── roles/
│   ├── implementer.toml
│   ├── reviewer.toml
│   ├── verifier.toml
│   └── frontend-specialist.toml
└── workflows/
    └── implement-review-verify.toml
```

Example:

```toml
id = "code-reviewer"
display_name = "Code Reviewer"
description = "Reviews an implementation without modifying files."

system_prompt = """
Review the supplied implementation for correctness, regressions,
security risks, maintainability issues, and missing verification.
Do not edit repository files.
"""

allowed_providers = ["omp", "codex", "pi"]
preferred_provider = "codex"

can_modify_files = false
can_delegate = false
requires_write_scope = false
requires_verification = false

allowed_tools = ["read", "search", "shell"]
output_schema = "review-report-v1"
```

## Future Workflow Engine

The MVP exposes only the fixed implementer → reviewer → verifier workflow.
The general DAG model below is a future extension and is not accepted by the
v1 public run contract.

Use a DAG with topological scheduling.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Planner --> API
    Planner --> UI
    Planner --> Tests

    API --> Integrator
    UI --> Integrator
    Tests --> Integrator

    Integrator --> Reviewer
    Reviewer --> Verifier
```

Execution waves:

```text
Wave 1: Planner
Wave 2: API, UI, Tests
Wave 3: Integrator
Wave 4: Reviewer
Wave 5: Verifier
```

A workflow node declares:

```rust
pub struct WorkflowNode {
    pub id: WorkflowNodeId,
    pub role_id: String,
    pub provider: ProviderSelector,
    pub depends_on: Vec<WorkflowNodeId>,
    pub input_artifacts: Vec<ArtifactSelector>,
    pub output_schema: String,
}
```

The first implementation does not need a general DAG editor. Start with:

```text
implementer → reviewer → verifier
```

Then introduce parallel waves.

## Agent Run Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2

    Completed --> [*]
    Invalid --> [*]
    Failed --> [*]

```

Normalized events:

```rust
pub enum AgentEvent {
    Starting,
    Ready,
    Thinking,

    RunningCommand {
        command: String,
    },

    EditingFile {
        path: PathBuf,
    },

    Verifying {
        command: String,
        index: usize,
        total: usize,
    },

    WaitingForInput {
        question: String,
    },

    ChildStarted {
        child: ProviderChildSession,
    },

    Progress {
        message: String,
    },

    Completed,
    Failed {
        message: String,
    },
    Cancelled,
}
```

## Structured Artifact Protocol

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Implementer -->|ImplementationReport| Store["Artifact Store"]
    Store -->|Task + Diff + Report| Reviewer

    Reviewer -->|ReviewReport| Store
    Store -->|Findings| Coordinator

    Coordinator -->|CorrectionPacket| Implementer
    Store -->|Implementation + Review| Verifier

    Verifier -->|VerificationReport| Store
```

Every artifact contains:

```rust
pub struct ArtifactEnvelope<T> {
    pub schema_version: u32,
    pub artifact_id: ArtifactId,

    pub workflow_run_id: Option<WorkflowRunId>,
    pub producer_run_id: AgentRunId,

    pub role_id: String,
    pub provider: ProviderKind,

    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub payload: T,
}
```

Large outputs are referenced rather than embedded.

Examples:

```text
artifact://implementation/run-0194
artifact://review/run-0195
artifact://verification/run-0196
patch://run-0194
transcript://run-0195
```

## Message and Handoff Bus

Messages carry short instructions and artifact references.

```rust
pub struct AgentMessage {
    pub id: MessageId,
    pub from: AgentRunId,
    pub to: AgentRunId,

    pub kind: MessageKind,
    pub text: String,
    pub artifact_refs: Vec<ArtifactRef>,
}
```

Suitable message content:

- Additional constraints
- Clarifying questions
- Blocked-state explanations
- Requests for review
- Notifications that an artifact is ready

Unsuitable message content:

- Complete diffs
- Large source files
- Full reports
- Entire transcripts

Provider mapping:

```text
OMP      → hub.send or prompt
Codex    → new turn
Pi       → steer, follow_up, or prompt
OpenCode → task_id continuation
```

## Repository Safety

The [Managed repository safety contract](research/mvp/repository-safety-contract.md)
is authoritative for the MVP's Linux containment, snapshot, scope, publication,
and recovery guarantees.

### Before Execution

- Validate the task is bounded
- Resolve repository and linked-worktree identity
- Acquire a kernel-owned Worktree Lease
- Capture a full immutable Repository Snapshot, including dirty, untracked, and ignored state
- Preserve existing user changes
- Validate exact-file, subtree, scratch, ignored, dirty, and destructive-change policy
- Prove the fail-closed Linux containment backend and model broker
- Resolve the effective role policy
- Resolve workspace isolation

### During Execution

- Project the snapshot through a private Run Overlay instead of mounting the live worktree
- Enforce role tool restrictions
- Enforce filesystem, process-tree, command, credential, and network policy independently of the provider
- Track and seal the candidate Publish Delta
- Record provider events
- Prevent overlapping editing runs
- Reject unresolved architecture decisions
- Enforce timeout and cancellation

### After Execution

- Validate the Publish Delta against the Repository Snapshot and effective policy
- Compare the complete live worktree and Git state with the baseline before publication
- Confirm verification commands match the task specification
- Publish through a durable journal and per-path compare-and-swap operations
- Preserve invalid overlays and quarantine uncertain or partial publication
- Never automatically revert published or unexpected changes
- Mark invalid runs explicitly
- Return diff and evidence to the parent agent

Provider-level tool restrictions are not sufficient security boundaries.

Pi explicitly runs with the permissions of the user and process that launched it and recommends containerization or sandboxing for stronger isolation.

## Workspace Isolation

```rust
pub enum WorkspaceIsolation {
    CurrentWorktree,
    IsolatedWorktree,
}
```

### Current Worktree

Use when:

- The task depends on uncommitted user changes
- The task is small and mechanical
- The validated candidate should publish back to the selected worktree

`CurrentWorktree` identifies the baseline and publication target. The provider
still executes against a private Run Overlay and never receives the live
worktree as a writable mount.

Rule:

> Only one editing workflow may hold the Worktree Lease for a worktree.

Read-only reviewers and verifiers may run concurrently when safe.

### Isolated Worktree

Use when:

- Tasks can be separated cleanly
- Multiple implementation nodes run in parallel
- Changes are high risk
- Integration should happen after independent review

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Main["Main Worktree"]

    Main --> API["Worktree A<br/>API Implementer"]
    Main --> UI["Worktree B<br/>UI Implementer"]
    Main --> Tests["Worktree C<br/>Test Writer"]

    API --> Integrator
    UI --> Integrator
    Tests --> Integrator

    Integrator --> Review
```

Merging remains a parent-agent or integrator responsibility.

## State Storage

Use SQLite for indexed runtime state and files for large artifacts.

```text
$HERDR_PLUGIN_STATE_DIR/
├── orchestrator.db
├── artifacts/
│   └── <artifact-id>.json
├── transcripts/
├── logs/
├── patches/
└── provider-state/
```

SQLite tables:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    WORKFLOW_RUN ||--o{ WORKFLOW_NODE : contains
    WORKFLOW_NODE ||--o{ AGENT_RUN : executes
    AGENT_RUN ||--o{ PROVIDER_SESSION : owns
    AGENT_RUN ||--o{ ARTIFACT : produces
    AGENT_RUN ||--o{ MESSAGE : sends
    AGENT_RUN ||--o{ VERIFICATION : performs
    AGENT_RUN ||--o{ AGENT_RUN : parent_of
```

Store in SQLite:

- Workflow runs

## Herdr UI

The real provider process runs in a normal Herdr pane. The popup only displays and controls the run.

- OMP session persistence
- Codex thread persistence
- Provider capability negotiation
- Resume
- Steering and follow-up
- Transcript retrieval
- Handoff packets
- Isolated worktrees

### Phase 3: Pi Provider

Implement:

- `pi --mode rpc`
- Pi session identity
- Prompt, steer, follow-up, and abort
- Event normalization
- Tool allowlist mapping
- Role system-prompt mapping
- Transcript and state retrieval
- Pi as managed implementer, reviewer, or verifier

### Phase 4: OMP Hybrid Mode

Implement:

- Native subagent subscriptions
- OMP child tree
- Native child transcripts
- `hub` message mapping
- Native depth limit
- Parent-run budget accounting
- Read-only native helpers first

### Phase 5: OpenCode Provider

Implement:

- OpenCode Session mapping
- Parent-child session trees
- `task_id` continuation
- Permission mapping
- Child-session popup
- Optional background-job support

### Phase 6: Custom Roles and Workflows

Implement:

- User role TOML or Markdown
- Role inheritance
- Policy presets
- Workflow YAML or TOML
